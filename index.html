        <h4 class="section section-text">"Every pizza is a personal pizza if you try hard and belive in yourself." -Unknown</h4>
        <p>Born and Raised in Dallas, Texas I moved around as an adult before finding my way to Toronto, Ontario.
            I grew up playing variou sports including Soccer, Basketball, and Football. As an adult I also picked up Hocky and Lacrosse.
            After i got engaged in 2019 both my fiancee and i realized we needed to improve ourselves and live the lives we wanted to live.
            So both of us decided to go back to college to get there and both chose George Brown in Toronto.
            She graduated from the nursing program with honors in late 2021 and now I am close to doing the same in early 2022. 
        </p>
        <p>As somebody with over 15 years of retail and sales experience, 4 of which have been in management, I have always learned to strive
            for the betterment of both myself and the team. Thanks to my my time in sales and playing competitive sports I have always learned to
            take critisicm in a positive manner and continue to work towards getting better. As I look forward to my every growing career I always
            understand that there is room for improvement and upwards movement and I will always be looking to keep moving forward.

        <a href="https://github.com/smartvoting/"><img alt="Smart Voting Github Link" src="images\favicon\GitHub-Mark\PNG\GitHub-Mark-Light-120px-plus.png" height="50px" width="50px"></a>
        <p><strong>Type:</strong> Web Application </br>
            <strong>Languages:</strong> .NET, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Quantum Ledger Database, Amazon Web Services, PostgreSQL, React, Rest API </br>
            Smart Voting is a Capstone Project during my time at George Brown College. It is a secure web application that allows
            for elections to be held digitally while ensuring the safety and security of the voting process and ballots.
            Smart Voting utilizes a ledger database to securely and transparently keep track of votes as they are cast. 
            As with all elections, ballots must be anonymous, but valid. This means checks must be done to make sure the voter is legally authorized to cast a ballot. 
            Additionally, election officials and parties want to know as much data as possible about how and where people voted. 
            There are various unique tools built into the system to assist with interpreting this data. 
            Some of these tools will be publicly available and others will only be accessible by election officials and parties.

        <p><strong>Type:</strong> Web Application </br>
            <strong>Languages:</strong> React, Rest API, Postman, HTML, CSS, Javascript</br>
            Basic web application that allowed for the addition, subtraCTION, and viewing of employees. The backend is A Rest Api based system that calls to a MongoDB database that is tested using Postman.
            The Front end is a basic react and javascript application used to fit the needs of the user. You can Add an employee, View them on the employee list page, and modify/delete fro mthe individual employees page.

        <p><strong>Type:</strong> Web Application </br>
            <strong>Languages:</strong> MongoDB, GraphQL, Postman</br>
            Simple AirBnB backend clone done for an Assignment During my Full Stack Development II class at George Brown.
            Using Graphql and a database with three seperate collections we allowed a user and an admin to be created. 
            The user could view listings and book their stays. The admin could could add and view Listings and bookings.
            All testing was done using postman and a postman collection was built for the turn in to show our testing data.

        <p><strong>Type:</strong> Web Application </br>
            <strong>Languages:</strong> React, Rest API, HTML, Javascript, CSS</br>
            Weather App done as a Labtest for Full Stack Development I at George Brown. The back end calls on an open source API that finds the weather based on input location.
            The front end allows the user input for the location and the app will pull up the weather there as well as change backgrounds based on the temperature.
